Hello

My name is Mr. Poco and I am currently 24 years old and I have started learning Python programming. I have a three-step plan that God willing, I will reach in about three years.

Step 1: Python + Git & GitHub + Database + Django + API

Step 2: Data & AI Foundations + Deep Learning + AI + Backend Integration + Cloud & Deployment

Step 3: Product Thinking + SaaS & Automation + Marketing & Growth + Monetization

"Between Fall and Rise"
